General plugins will go here.

You can also set a path to your plugin manually in the settings file, to run files outside of this directory.

This helps keep your code clean and organized.

An example is having a block that needs processing, you can load a file from:

/blocks/yourblock/rtms/rtms_library.php <-- this file can be loaded in to RTMS, and you can keep that code in your github.

The other plugins found in this directory are more 'global utility' type plugins maintained specifically by contributors to RTMS.
